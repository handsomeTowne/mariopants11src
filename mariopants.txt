Mariopants v1.1
===============

The goal with this tool is an easy to use Mario Paint music
editor that sounds and performs very close to the original game.

This tool was created by Brad Smith (rainwarrior), based on the original
game and earlier tools by Strobe and Setrodox. It is open source.
Please send any questions or comments via my website.

Currently this program is availble for Win32 and Mac OSX (10.6+),
and source code is available to build for Linux.
If you would like to help port it to another platform, please contact me.

The Windows build may require the Visual C++ 2010 x86 runtime components.
If you are missing MSVCR100.dll, please download and install it from Microsoft:
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555

This program uses the following two open source libraries:
  1. SDL - a cross platform multimedia framework.
     http://www.libsdl.org
  2. zlib - gzip file compression required for SNES9X savestates.
     http://www.zlib.net

The zlib library is used for the gzip compression/decompression
needed to work with SNES9X save states. (http://www.zlib.net)

During playback, any key or click will stop playback, except to adjust tempo.
When using the info page, Tab and Enter will cycle between text fields.


Graphical Interface
===================

The top row shows the current instrument, and a row of icons to select
a different instrument. Clicking on the staff will place a note on the
staff using that instrument (up to 3 on any beat).

The rightmost icon is a tool to set the length of the song. Clicking the
song length tool on the staff will place the end barline there.
To extend a song that is not already at the maximum length, scroll to the
right of the end barline and click there with the length tool.

Below the staff is a panel with the following icons:

[ Stop ] .... Indicates that playback is stopped.
[ Play ] .... Begin playback.
[ Loop ] .... Repeats the song when the end is reached.
[ Tempo ] ... Controls the speed.
[ Scroll ] .. Scrolls the staff left or right to navigate the song.
[ Clear ] ... Erases the entire song.

The bottom row contains a series of icons:

[ Bomb ] ..... Quits the program.
[ Eraser ] ... Erases notes.
[ A B C ] .... Channel select.
[ 3/4 ] ...... Uses 3 beats per measure.
[ 4/4 ] ...... Uses 4 beats per measure.
[ Save ] ..... Saves the current document, green indicates no changes.
[ Save As ] .. Saves to a new or different file.
[ Load ] ..... Loads from file.
[ Info ] ..... Info page with song title and author.
[ Undo ] ..... Undoes the last modification to the document.


Notes
=====

Shift+Click will use the eraser instead of entering a note.

Ctrl+Click to listen to a beat instead of editing.
This is useful for previewing harmony without playing back the whole song.

Right click will act as either a Shift+Click or a Ctrl+Click.
Press F8 to toggle between these two behaviours.

When saving or loading a file, the type of data saved is
based on the extension of the file.
  .sho - Shroom Player file
  .zst - ZSNES savestate (versions 143 to 151) also .zs1-sz9
  .000 - SNES9X savestate (version 1.53) also .001-008
  .wav - WAV render

When writing to savestates, if the file already exists, the music
data will be inserted into it, replacing only the music.
If it does not already exist a default savestate will be provided.

To pass the saved data to other emulators, you can use an SNES9X
or ZSNES savestate to create an .srm file that can be used with other
emulators by activating the Mario Paint game's save feature in that
emulator. (If anyone has reverse engineered the Mario Paint .srm
format, please contact me.)

Looped songs when rendered to WAV will play the loop twice,
then fade out. A smpl chunk is included, which can be used
by an appropriate WAV editor to create perfect loop, if needed.

The song title and author information is only saved in the
.sho format. A savestate does not contain this data.

Unlike the original editor, undo can be used repeatedly to undo
long chains of modifications.

Due to technical limitations, playback is not strictly synchronized
with the audio, it is only an approximation. Your display may be slightly
before or ahead of the audio you hear. If tempo is adjusted during
playback it may get very desynchronized due to the latency.


Advanced Techniques
===================

This editor allows you to stack up to three notes on the same
spot. This was not allowed by the original game's editor, but it is
properly supported by the game if placed in its music data.

Channel select is another advanced feature that was not allowed
by the original editor, but is supported by its engine. The three
notes entered into a beat noramlly go into three separate channels,
in the order they were placed (A,B,C). On the next beat if a new note
is played on the same channel, it will cut off the previous sound
on that channel. By placing notes on specific channels, you can
have better control over how the sounds will overlap.
When stacked, channel A appears at the bottom, C at the top.

When channel select is off, it will enter notes automatically into
the three channels in order, like the original game. With channel
select on, notes will be entered only into the selected channel,
and will overwrite any note already in that channel.
When using an eraser with channel select off, the beat will
automatically reorganize the remaining notes on channels A,B
or just A. Use the eraser with channel select on to avoid this.

Extended song sizes (longer than 96 columns) may be enabled by pressing F9.
This will save and load as .sho files, but songs longer than 96 cannot
saved as individual savestates. A series of up to 30 sequential savestates
can be exported by pressing F10.

The extended limit mode will be indicated by a red highlight on the scroll bar.


Hardware Accuracy
=================

The samples were recorded from SNES9X at the SNES native 32000Hz samplerate.
Every instrument has been recorded at every playable pitch.
Sound rendering is done at 320000Hz to preserve fidelity.

The original SNES game has a complicated tempo algorithm, which generates
a slightly uneven beat. This is not emulated, in favour of a smoother,
perfectly even beat.

On the SNES game, when 2 or 3 notes are played on the same beat
sometimes, but only rarely, one of these notes plays with a slight
delay from the others. This is not emulated.

The delta action of SNES ADPCM samples is not emulated. The recorded samples
are regular PCM. To prevent pops when interrupting a playing sample, there
is a 32ms fade on the interrupted sample.
