Mariopants
----------

For information about the Win32 or MacOSX version, see mariopants.txt.
For information about building the Win32 or MacOSX versions, see source.txt

To build and run mariopants, you'll need SDL, zlib, Tcl, and Tk. Some
distributions (such as Debian-based ones) split these libraries into separate
packages for development and runtime use. If you use one of these
distributions, you will need both versions of each library.

Running `make install` as root should be sufficient for a full installation.
